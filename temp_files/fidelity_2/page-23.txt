EAI Estimated Annual Income (EAI) & Estimated Yield (EY) - EAI is an estimate of annual income for a specific security position over the next rolling 12 months. EAI may be negative on short
& EY positions. EY is calculated by dividing the current EAI for a security position by its statement closing date market value. EAI and EY are estimates only and may include return of principal
     and/or capital gains, which would render them overstated. Actual income and yield might be lower or higher than the estimated amounts. For calculation details, refer to the
     "Additional Information and Endnotes" section.

AI    (Accrued Interest) - Represents interest accumulated since the last coupon date, but not yet paid by the issuer or received by NFS. There is no guarantee that AI will be paid by the
      issuer. Please refer to the Help/Glossary section of Fidelity.com for additional information.
