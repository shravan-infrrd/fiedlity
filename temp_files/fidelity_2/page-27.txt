Estimated Annual Income (EAI) & Estimated Yield (EY) - EAI for fixed income is calculated using the coupon rate. For all other securities, EAI is calculated using an
indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a security's dividend payments for the next 12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for
that security. EY reflects only the income generated by an investment and not changes in its price which may fluctuate. Interest and dividend rates are subject to change at
any time and may be affected by current and future economic, political and business conditions. EAI and EY are provided for informational purposes only and should not
be used or relied on for making investment, trading or tax decisions. EAI and EY are based on data obtained from information providers believed to be reliable, but no
assurance can be made as to accuracy, timeliness or completeness. Please refer to the Help/Glossary on Fidelity.com for additional information regarding these
calculations.
